=================

Installation Changes
--------------------

- Significant expansion of PypeIt's use of the cache system; see
  :ref:`data_installation`.  Important changes include that most cached files
  are now version dependent.  When upgrading to new versions of PypeIt, users
  should delete their cache and start fresh.

Dependency Changes
------------------

- Support added for numpy>=2.0.0; numpy<=2.0.0 should still be supported

Functionality/Performance Improvements and Additions
----------------------------------------------------

Instrument-specific Updates
---------------------------

- GMOS-South: PypeIt reductions of GMOS-South MOS observations now properly
  account for tilted slits in the mask design file. Previously, these data
  could only be reduced without including any information from the slitmask
  design.

Script Changes
--------------

- Modifications to the cache-related :ref:`install_scripts` to accommodate
  expansion of and changes to the cache system.
- Added ``pypeit_clean_cache`` script to facilitate both viewing and removing
  files in the cache.

Datamodel Changes
-----------------

Under-the-hood Improvements
---------------------------

- Introduced :class:`~pypeit.pypeitdata.PypeItDataPaths` to handle all
  interactions with the ``pypeit/data`` directory, which provides a unified
  interface for accessing on-disk and cached files.

Bug Fixes
---------

- None
